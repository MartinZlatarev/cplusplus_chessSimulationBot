To use the simulation you MUSTN'T write the moves in algebraic chess notation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)), but in a different notation, in which you first write the staring position
(i.e. e2) and then the final position (i.e. e4), which would result in e2e4. You also MUST include a '+' or '#' at the end if the move is check or checkmate respectively.
